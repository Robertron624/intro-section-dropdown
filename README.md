## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Material UI](https://mui.com/) - Javascript UI library
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) - Vite development tool 


### What I learned

It was my first expriencie using Material UI for adding a drawer and accordion menus to the mobile layout. It was fun and simple to use.

### Continued development

I'll use more material UI and its competitors to develop faster projects using it's basic components like menus, submenus, drawers etc.


### Useful resources

- [Material UI Accordion](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-accordion/) - This helped to create the accordion menus for the mobile drawer.
- [Material UI Drawer](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-drawer/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
